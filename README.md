# NLP Illustrated
Illustrating NLP algorithms: one algorithm at a time.

# Brief
I created this repository to publish my work on illustrating NLP algorithms.
I will start by the most basic and increase complexity throughtout the journey.
I will commit myself to a 30 min each two days.
My reference will be "[Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) (3rd ed. draft) by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin"
Wish me luck!
